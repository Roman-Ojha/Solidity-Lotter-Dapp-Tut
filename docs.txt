*) What you will learn?
    -> Deployment of smart contract on Ethereum Blockchain
    -> Role of MetaMask
    -> Role of Test Network

*) Role Involved:
    -> Manager
    -> Participants

*) Algorithm:
    -> Participants needs to be at least >= 3
    -> If Participants are baying lottery with 2 ether then they have to send 2 ether into smart contract
    -> Manager will manage all the process
    -> if Participants are = 3
        -> Total ether = 3 * 2 = 6
    -> we will select randomly and that Participants will will 6 ether

*) Points ot note:
    -> Participant must have wallet.
    -> A Participant can transfer ether more than one time but the transferred ether must be 2 ether.
    -> As the participant will transfer ether its address will be registered.
    -> Manager will have full control over the lottery.
    -> The contract will be reset one a round is completed.
